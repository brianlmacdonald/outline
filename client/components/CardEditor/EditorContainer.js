//I'm editing project.
//I want to switch the order of the acts.
//The container has a button that switches
//moveUp = parent.array.get(down)
//moveDown = parent.array.get(up)
//parent.array.set(down, moveDown)
//parent.array.set(up, moveUp)
//you'd need the index prop, and the lists to be sorted as they're loaded.
